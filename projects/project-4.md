## Going "Beyond the Library"?

When it comes time to find a place to study, the first location that comes to mind is the
 library. While the library is a solid choice as a study location, it may be old, crowded, and rather plain
  environment to be cooped up in for hours on end. The problem here is that plenty of students are not aware of the
   multitude of other study locations that exist. Hence, working in a team of 4 students, we designed a web
    application to help UH students go "Beyond the Library" and discover as well as share study spots both on and off
     the UH Manoa campus.
