summary: A text-based dungeon crawling game for EE205, Object Oriented Programing in C++.
---

SoulQuest is a text-based dungeon crawler game inspired by the likes of Frontier and Oregon Trail. This was completed along with several other students for EE205, a course on object oriented programing with C++.

The premise of the game is as follows: "Through unfortunate circumstances, your beloved wife died in a fire and wish to see her once again. In a desperate bid, you sell your soul to a demon for a chance of bringing your wife back from the underworld. Halfway through the ritual, you blackout and awake in the Demon's dungeon. It was a trick! Now you must make your way through the dungeon, confront the demon and reclaim your soul (and maybe your wife)."
