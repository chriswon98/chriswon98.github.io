## My journey so far

First off, I would like to mention how lucky the younger generation is to experience programing at a young age. At my old high school, they now host summer camps for elmentary schoolers to learn coding for several weeks. I cannot reverse time and redo my life with coding at an early age. For those starting off in their later years, this is a story for you.

As a high schooler, I wanted to become an aerospace engineer but there were no such programs avaiable in Hawaii back in 2016. Thus, I went for my second choice to study electrical engineering. It wasn't until the second semester of college that I took my first course in programing, an introduction to C. 

## It's like riding a bike

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## Problem solving?

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
