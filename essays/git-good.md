## My journey so far

First off, I would like to mention how lucky the younger generation is to experience programing at a young age. At my old high school, they now host summer camps for elmentary schoolers to learn coding for several weeks. I cannot reverse time and start coding from an early age. For those starting off in their later years, this is a story for you.

As a high schooler, I wanted to become an aerospace engineer but there were no such programs avaiable in Hawaii back in 2016. Thus, I went for my second choice to study electrical engineering. It wasn't until the second semester of college that I took my first course in programing, an introduction to C. I struggled in the beginning as most of my peers had some background in programing and they easily finished programing assignments. I, on the other hand, was usually one of the last to finish. I felt like I was slamed to the ground and couldn't get up. It was then and there that I decided that I needed to change my approach.

The first step was getting help from my professor and TA. I asked them if they could explain the concepts in a different way as I didn't catch on in the lecture. The second step, and prehaps the key step, was a lot of practice. This involved redoing the practice code several times and trying my own variations of that code. Eventually, I caught up to my peers and could preform just as well as they did. Several years later, I am proficent in several languages (C, C++, Python) and have greater confidence in my programing skills.

## It's like riding a bike

As mentioned earlier, practice is key. I like to remind myself that coding is like riding a bike. The first few attempts are highly to result in the bike crashing. With warning and errors flashing on the screen, it can feel highly discouraging to get on that bike again. From there progress is gradually made until the training wheels come off and more complicated manuvers (i.e. object oriented programing) are attempted. Then comes large projects like creating a video game. All along the way it is possible (and likely) for the bike to crash again. However, practice is what helps riding the bike (coding) to be less scary and decreses the chances of severe bike crashes in the future.

## Problem solving?

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
