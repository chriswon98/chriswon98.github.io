## JavaScript vs the rest of the crowd

I have come to understand that there is no single best language to learn. Each language has its strengths and thus scnerios where it is most useful. For example, the C programing language is great for writing code to run on hardware, but not ideal for writing webpages. Initally, working with JavaScript was rather bizzare to me. As a student from the engineering program, most of my experience and training has been with C. I have some experience with using C++ and Python, but I always fall back to C since I am most familiar with it. The biggest difficulty was understanding the syntax and the high-level functionality of JavaScript. 

## No, I don't want to print

Prehaps one of the most prominent cases for "old habbits die hard" was using "print" instead of "console.log()". As a result, my computer brought up the printer window everytime I ran my code. It wasn't until I talked with a fellow classmate that kindly reminded me that I wasn't using the correct syntax for JavaScript.  

## Yeah, they're all numbers

Another point of confusion was that JavaScript placed both integers and floats under one data type. I was honestly surprised at this because C seperates integers and floats. Thus doing mathematical operations between integers and floats has been a messy ordeal for me as incorrectly or forgetting to convert between the two caused a lot of headaches in my old programs. It was sorth of a breath of fresh air when I could add the two different numbers seemesly using JavaScript.

## My view on athletic software engineering

Although, I do understand the good intentions of the athletic software engineering model, I am currently not fan of it. This is in part laregly due to the time constraints to complete the workout of the day. For me, working under the clock puts a lot of pressure on me to attempt to finish the exercise as fast as possible. This concentration on finishing fast in turn makes it difficult to actually focus on solving the problem. This sometimes results in me "freezing up" as I can't get out of the cycle and time eventually runs out. The concern of finishing fast also leads to a sloppy job as I keep debugging to a minimal in an attempt to save time (though this does end up costing me more time in the long run). However, I due understand the nature of the atheltic software enfgineering model si to improve our programing and problem solving skills. After all, technical interviews for major companies will be similar in presenting a programming prompt to be solved in a limited amount of time.

## Looking forward

Overall, I think JavaScript is a powerful tool once it is properly understood. As of now, it is more of a hammer that hit my finger until I can sort out the syntax and usage differences between it and C. Buiding confidence is also key as it is the other barrier preventing me from gaining any benefit from the athelitc software engineering model. However, failing to complete the first exercise is not the end and it is important to learn to read the function documentation better before rushing to submit an answer.
