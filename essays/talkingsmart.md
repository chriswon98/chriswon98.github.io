## Asking Questions Is All About the Form

Perhaps you have heard something similiar at some point in your life. It may have been from a teacher trying to encourage the students to break the silence of the classroom. Maybe you heard it from your parents as they taught you how to interact with society. Wheter or not you have heard this phrase before, it is important to continue to ask questions in order to grow as a person. This is especially true for software engineers as it is virtually impossible to know all the anwsers. Therefore, to become a smarter software engineer, questions are essential. However, there is caveat to asking questions as improperly formulating your question can lead to redicule or even no response at all.

## A Crash Course to Smart Questions

Eric Raymond's ["How to Ask Questions the Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) is an excellent launch pad to start the journey to asking smart questions. In general, you should make an honest attempt at solving your problem before asking others. This can be done several ways, including searching the internet, reading the manual, and visiting a FAQ section. This is to avoid looking "lazy" and deonstrate your not there to leech off others. If you cannot solve the problem on your own, be sure to be respectiful when asking other individuals for their assistance. Your message should be gramatically corrrect and free from spelling errors. Additionally, your question should be focused and asseciable. It is key to remember that a stranger is lending their time to address your question.

## Example 1: A Question Asked the "Smart" Way

The following [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example) follows the guidelines for asking a question the smart way. In this example, the user makes his question asseciable by sperating the code into code blocks for others to try his code. Additionally, he clearly states his goals by explaining what the desired result is and what is curretly being outputed.

It outputs this:
