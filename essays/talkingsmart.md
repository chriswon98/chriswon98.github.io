## Asking Questions Is All About the Form

> "But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question"

Perhaps you have heard something similiar at some point in your life. It may have been from a teacher trying to encourage the students to break the silence of the classroom. Maybe you heard it from your parents as they taught you how to interact with society. Wheter or not you have heard this phrase before, it is important to continue to ask questions in order to grow as a person. This is especially true for software engineers as it is virtually impossible to know all the anwsers. Therefore, to become a smarter software engineer, questions are essential. However, there is caveat to asking questions as improperly formulating your question can lead to redicule or even no response at all.

## A Crash Course to Smart Questions

Eric Raymond's ["How to Ask Questions the Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) is an excellent launch pad to start the journey to asking smart questions. In general, you should make an honest attempt at solving your problem before asking others. This can be done several ways, including searching the internet, reading the manual, and visiting a FAQ section. This is to avoid looking "lazy" and deonstrate your not there to leech off others. If you cannot solve the problem on your own, be sure to be respectiful when asking other individuals for their assistance. Your message should be gramatically corrrect and free from spelling errors. Additionally, your question should be focused and asseciable. It is key to remember that a stranger is lending their time to address your question.

## Example 1: A Question Asked the "Smart" Way

The following [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example) follows the guidelines for asking a question the smart way. In this example, the user makes his question asseciable by organizaing his sample code into code blocks for others to try his code. Additionally, he clearly states his goals by explaining what the desired result is and what is curretly being outputed.

```
It outputs this:

My value: 3
My value: 3
My value: 3

Whereas I'd like it to output:

My value: 0
My value: 1
My value: 2
```

These actions also indicate that the user attempted solving the problem several times on his own before posting to Stack Overflow. This increases the likelihood of reciving help as the community won't see him as trying to leech of the time of others. Similarly, the top rated answer also follows the guideline recommended by Mr. Raymond. The developer directly addressed the user's question before proceeding into deeper explaination as to why. For each of the three explainations, the code was placed into code blocks for ease of access.

## Example 2: A Question Asked the _Not_ "Smart" Way

On the other hand, the following [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39812613/fix-this-please) is an example of how not to ask in the smart way. First off, the user simply writes "Fix This Please" as the title of his question. This is very ambigous and gives no indication to the nature of the problem such as the programing language. Then the user provides the sample code in the format of a blurry screenshot. This makes it difficult for the person assisting to read the code and interact with the code. It isn't until the end of the post that the user mentions trouble with "apostrophes and ticks." While it is a more detailed explaination that what was provided in the title, the exact nature of his problem is still ambigous. There is no indication of any prior troubleshooting steps done by the user. Overall, the user's tone seems to indicate laziness and a desire for someonelse to do all the heavylifting for him. Meanwhile, the sole person who answered the question demonstrated assecibility with code blocks, was not ambigious, and used a respectful tone.

## Key Takeaway

In conclusion, I have come to realize that there are no "dumb questions" but there are "dumb" ways to ask a question. While trying to adhere to all the guidelines pointed out by Mr. Raymond may appear tedious, I think it is important to increase the likelyhood of reciving an answer and respecting the time a stranger has put aside to address my question. As a general rule moving forward, I will put myself in the shoes of those viewing my question and ensure the proper orgnization and respect is in place before hitting that "submit" button.
